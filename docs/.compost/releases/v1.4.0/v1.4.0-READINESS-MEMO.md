# v1.4.0 Readiness Memo

Date: 2026-02-15
Status: ready to begin v1.4.0 milestone work

## Decision
v1.3 stabilization rounds are complete through v1.3.26 final gate criteria, and the project can proceed to v1.4.0 implementation scope.

## Readiness Evidence
- Contract freeze gate is green (`v1.3.x` artifacts hash-locked).
- Long-run soak coverage for map tick + event ingestion is green.
- Capability matrix sign-off across Core/Wizard/TOYBOX lanes is green.
- Benchmark sign-off gate is green in strict mode.
- Final debug hygiene aggregate is green with unused-function candidates reviewed/approved.

## Residual Risk
- TOYBOX lifecycle has been migrated to FastAPI lifespan handlers; continue monitoring for upstream FastAPI API-shape changes.
- Dead-code sweep uses static heuristics; candidate list remains advisory unless tied to behavior regressions.

## Next Milestone Start Point
Use `docs/specs/v1.4.0-KICKOFF-CHECKLIST.md` as the execution entrypoint for v1.4.0.
