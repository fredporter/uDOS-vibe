# v1.3.24 Core Stabilization Round B Checklist

Status: active (2026-02-15)

## Cross-Lens Parity Expansion

- [x] Extend parity suite to validate multi-step quest-chain state invariants.
- [x] Extend parity suite to validate reward invariants (`xp`, `gold`, mission counters) across 2D and adapter lanes.
- [ ] Add explicit parity coverage for mixed chain flow (`ENTER -> MOVE -> COMPLETE -> COMPLETE`) with regression assertions.

Primary test artifact:
- `core/tests/v1_3_24_parity_reward_invariants_test.py`

## World-State Migration Smoke Tests

- [x] Add migration smoke test for replay/state loading from earlier v1.3.x snapshots.
- [x] Verify backward-compatible defaults are merged without state loss.
- [x] Add CI smoke entrypoint for migration regression.

## Benchmark History + Regression Delta Alerts

- [x] Persist benchmark history snapshots under `memory/reports/benchmarks/`.
- [x] Add regression delta evaluator against previous snapshot.
- [x] Emit warning/fail thresholds for latency/throughput drift.

## Command Capability Matrix (Negative Paths)

- [x] Add negative-path tests for role/capability denials.
- [x] Add matrix tests for blocked/invalid command forms.
- [x] Ensure command errors remain structured and deterministic.

## Debug Round B Hygiene

- [x] Remove flagged duplicate functions.
- [x] Remove or annotate unused private functions.
- [x] Resolve legacy markers in active code paths.
