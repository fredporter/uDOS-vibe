# v1.3.26 Core Stabilization Release Notes

Date: 2026-02-15

## Summary
v1.3.26 closes the Core stabilization track with final gate coverage for command/runtime contracts, capability matrix sign-off, benchmark sign-off, and final debug hygiene approval.

## Final Gates Executed
- Command/runtime stabilization pass:
  - `tools/ci/check_v1_3_26_final_stabilization.py`
- Capability matrix sign-off (Core/Wizard/TOYBOX):
  - `tools/ci/check_v1_3_26_capability_matrix_signoff.py`
- Benchmark sign-off against mission thresholds (strict mode):
  - `tools/ci/check_v1_3_26_benchmark_signoff.py`
- Debug Round Final aggregate:
  - `tools/ci/check_v1_3_26_debug_round_final.py`

## Key Artifacts
- `memory/reports/v1_3_26_benchmark_signoff.json`
- `memory/reports/v1_3_26_debug_round_final.json`
- `memory/reports/v1_3_25_release_checklist.json`
- `memory/reports/v1_3_25_runtime_hardcoded_paths.json`
- `memory/reports/v1_3_25_dead_code_sweep.json`

## Stabilization Outcomes
- No contract regressions detected in frozen v1.3.x contract surfaces.
- Capability denials and TOYBOX lane lifecycle checks are passing.
- Runtime code paths are clean of hardcoded local machine paths.
- Deprecated/depreciated markers in active runtime code paths are zero.
- Duplicate top-level Python functions in scanned code paths are zero.
- Unused-function candidate report reviewed and approved for v1.3.x closure.

## Notes
- Capability sign-off emits upstream FastAPI deprecation warnings (`on_event`) from TOYBOX adapter startup/shutdown hooks. These are non-blocking for v1.3.26 and can be migrated in v1.4.
