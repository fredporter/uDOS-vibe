## GA Phase Summary

| Phase | Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| RC1 | Burn-in cycle: multi-day reliability run | ✅ | `docs/devlog/2026-02-23-ga1-rc-burn-in-runbook-and-triage-checklist.md` |
| GA1 | RC burn-in complete (3 consecutive green) | ✅ | Same file — Day 1/2/3 all green, no P0/P1 |
| GA2 | Post-RC stabilization + doc finalization | ✅ | Architecture convergence sprint (2026-02-26) |
| GA3 | Operator runbooks tested end-to-end | ✅ | `docs/howto/UCODE-OFFLINE-OPERATOR-RUNBOOK.md`, `SEED-INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md`, `SERVER-MANAGEMENT.md` |
| GA4 | Final security audit + dependency scan | ✅ | `docs/devlog/2026-02-24-security-audit.md`; `.env` not in git, CI secrets gate active |

## Extended Integration Test Matrix (2026-02-26)

Run command:
```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest --ignore=wizard/tests/test_ucode_registry_warnings.py -q
```

| Lane | Result |
|---|---|
| Core (`core/tests/`) | ✅ |
| Wizard (`wizard/tests/`) | ✅ |
| Full (`tests/`) | ✅ |
| **Total** | **2280 passed, 6 skipped** |

Pre-existing P3 failures (not regressions — see `docs/known-issues.md`):
- `KI-001` — `tui_genre_manager` yaml module-level import
- `KI-002` — telemetry `send_telemetry_event` returns `''` vs `None`

## Architecture Convergence Sprint (2026-02-26)

All 8 convergence items resolved before GA close:

| Item | Description | Commit |
|---|---|---|
| P1 | `/health` + `/api/dashboard/health` merged → `health_probe()` | `007b042` |
| P2 | Dead `wizard.json` read removed | `6c4c953` |
| P3 | Notification history unified (JSONL → SQLite via Protocol) | `007b042` |
| P4 | AI provider status consolidated to `AIProviderHandler` | `07ce276` |
| P5 | Core → Wizard circular import fixed (lazy imports in `ucode.py`) | `4e05561` |
| P6 | `/api/self-heal/status` wired to `collect_self_heal_summary()` | `07ce276` |
| P7 | `admin_secret_contract` → `secret_vault` naming resolved | `07ce276` |
| P8 | Workspace filepicker hardened — root consistency + traversal guard | `5897605` |

## Security Audit Disposition (GA4)

Incident: 2026-02-24 (`.env` secrets exposure).

Remediation completed before GA close:
- ✅ `.env` is `.gitignore`d and NOT tracked in git (`git ls-files .env` → empty)
- ✅ `.env.example` template committed — no real secrets, correct structure
- ✅ CI secrets detection gate active (`.github/workflows/secrets-check.yml`)
- ✅ Wizard `secrets.tomb` (Fernet-encrypted) is the canonical secrets store
- ✅ Secret Store CLI available for rotation: `wizard/tools/secret_store_cli.py`
