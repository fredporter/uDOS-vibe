# M2.1 Doc Compost Cleanup

Date: 2026-02-22

## Goal

Complete remaining M2.1 documentation hygiene by removing duplicate/conflicting active planning artifacts and composting superseded material.

## Changes

- Composted superseded checklist:
  - moved `docs/vibe-todo.md`
  - to `docs/.compost/historic/vibe-todo-legacy-checklist-2026-02-22.md`

## Why

- `docs/roadmap.md` is the canonical planning source.
- Keeping both files active duplicated milestone/checklist tracking and created drift risk.

## Roadmap Update

- Marked complete in `docs/roadmap.md` under `M2.1 Structure Validation`:
  - Remove or compost obsolete legacy-runtime planning/spec files no longer part of execution.
  - Eliminate duplicate docs that conflict with the `vibe-cli` execution model.
