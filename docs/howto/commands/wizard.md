# Wizard Commands

Version: Core/Wizard v1.3.16
Updated: 2026-02-15

Wizard owns provider, integration, and full-system network-aware checks.

Domain boundary note:
- `WIZARD ...` is the core command surface for Wizard server/provider/integration operations.
- `WIZOPS ...` is the Vibe skill surface for automation/task orchestration.
- Legacy Vibe `WIZARD ...` skill calls are accepted as a temporary compatibility alias to `WIZOPS`.
