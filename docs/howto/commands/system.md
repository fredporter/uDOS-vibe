Core system commands are offline/local first.

```

## REBOOT

## Runtime path updates in v1.3.16

Pattern and dataset top-level commands moved:

- `PATTERN ...` -> `DRAW PAT ...`
- `DATASET ...` -> `RUN DATA ...`

Examples:

```bash
DRAW PAT LIST
DRAW --py PAT CYCLE
DRAW --md MAP
DRAW --md --save diagrams/map-demo.md DEMO
RUN DATA LIST
RUN DATA VALIDATE locations
```

## Removed from Core (hard fail)

- `SHAKEDOWN`
- `INTEGRATION`
- `PROVIDER`
- `PATTERN`
- `DATASET`

Use Wizard surfaces for provider/integration/full-system checks.
