# Home Assistant Bridge Contract

**Status:** Planned for v1.5 stable (Cycle D)

## Goal
Expose a minimal contract so Home Assistant can discover uDOS services and interact via Wizard.

---

## Wizard Endpoint
`/api/ha/`

## Contract Files
- **Wizard API contract (this doc):** `docs/HOME-ASSISTANT-BRIDGE.md`
- **Service definition + routes:** `library/home-assistant/bridge.json`

### Required Routes (v1.5 target)
- `GET /api/ha/status`
  - Returns bridge status and version.
- `GET /api/ha/discover`
  - Returns available uDOS entities/services.
- `POST /api/ha/command`
  - Execute safe uDOS/uHOME controller commands (restricted allowlist).

```

## Container Link
- Home Assistant container exists at `library/home-assistant/`.
- `library/home-assistant/bridge.json` is the canonical service definition for the Wizard bridge.
- This document explains the uDOS side (Wizard API surface and policy).

## uHOME Controller UX Scope

The bridge is the control plane for uHOME game-controller UX surfaces:
- broadcast source/tuner discovery
- DVR rule control
- ad-processing mode control
- playback target handoff
