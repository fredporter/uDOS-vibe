# Historical Earthly Adventure

Slide 1 - Oath At The Crossroads

Your boots sink into rain-dark soil as bells ring from the old city walls.
In the year `$world_year`, history is unstable, and your choices now shape what survives.
You are not a tourist. You are a witness, courier, and keeper of fragments.

Slide 8 - Runtime Event Normalization Payload (Template)

```yaml
stats_delta:
  xp: 25
  hp: -5
  gold: 40
progress:
  level: 2
  achievement_id: "earth_archive_discovered"
location:
  grid_id: "earth:history:fortress-02"
  x: 14
  y: 6
  z: 1
```

-----

Slide 9 - RULE/PLAY Condition Contract

Use RULE as gameplay automation paired with PLAY.

Example rule definitions:

```text
RULE ADD rule.history.route_fortress IF xp>=80 and level>=2 THEN TOKEN token.history.fortress_access; PLAY dungeon
RULE ADD rule.history.city_trust IF achievement_level>=1 and gold>=50 THEN TOKEN token.history.city_trust
RULE ADD rule.history.ascension IF gate:dungeon_l32_amulet and achievement_level>=1 THEN TOKEN token.history.ascension; PLAY ascension
```

Supported IF condition patterns:
- `xp>=N`
- `hp>=N`
- `gold>=N`
- `level>=N`
- `achievement_level>=N`
- `metric.<name>>=N`
- `gate:<gate_id>`
- `token:<token_id>`
- `toybox=<profile>`

Supported THEN actions:
- `TOKEN <token_id>`
- `PLAY <option>`
- `GATE COMPLETE <gate_id>`
- `STAT ADD <xp|hp|gold> <delta>`
- `ACHIEVE <achievement_id>`
