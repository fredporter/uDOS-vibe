uDOS - Universal Device Operating System
Main entry point: uCODE Unified Terminal TUI

uCODE is the pivotal single-entry-point Terminal TUI for uDOS that:
- Auto-detects available components (core, wizard, extensions)
- Gracefully falls back to core-only mode if other components are missing
- Handles extension/plugin packaging and distribution
- Controls Wizard server and exposes its pages
- Routes all core commands through the dispatcher
