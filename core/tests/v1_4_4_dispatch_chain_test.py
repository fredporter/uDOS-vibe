"""
v1.4.4 Three-Stage Dispatch Chain Tests

Tests the uCODE three-stage command dispatch chain:
  Stage 1: uCODE exact matching (PLAY, MUSIC, etc.)
  Stage 2: Shell syntax validation (subprocess safety)
  Stage 3: VIBE fallback (local AI for unknown commands)

Validates:
- Command contract matching (v1.3.20)
- Alias resolution (typo correction via Levenshtein)
- Shell escape safety checks
- Graceful fallback to VIBE
- NEW/EDIT → FILE normalization
- Mode-specific routing (Mode 2 vs Mode 3)

Dispatch flow:
  Input → Parse → Normalize (NEW→FILE) → Stage1 (uCODE match)
  → Stage2 (shell validation) → Stage3 (VIBE) → Response
