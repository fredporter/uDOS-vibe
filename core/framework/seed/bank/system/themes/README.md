# Theme Seeds

These JSON files seed the Core TUI message-IO theme layer.

Contract:
- Theme scope is terminal message wording only.
- `replacements` should stay narrowly scoped to message labels/ops terms.
- GUI/CSS/WebView theming is not handled here.

A copy of this folder lands in `memory/system/themes/` on first run; edit those
runtime files for local experimentation, then port intentional changes back.

Legacy archive:
- `core/framework/seed/bank/system/themes/.archive/2026-02-15-legacy-broad-replacements/`
