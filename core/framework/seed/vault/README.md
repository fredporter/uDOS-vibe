# uDOS Vault Template

This folder is the **distributable markdown framework** for Obsidian Companion.

It is intentionally empty of personal data. Keep only starter docs and folder structure here.

## Workspaces

- `@inbox/` incoming captures to process
- `@sandbox/` drafts and experiments
- `@binders/` active thematic collections
- `@shared/` collaboration and selective sharing
- `@public/` publish-ready content
- `@private/` personal/private markdown notes

## Important

Runtime user vault data is stored in `memory/vault/`.
Seed content should be authored under `core/framework/seed/vault/` and installed into `memory/vault/`.
