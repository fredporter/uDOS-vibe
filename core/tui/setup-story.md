# Core Setup

Quick setup: 5 essential fields for your local .env file.

**Extended settings** (API keys, cloud services, etc.) are configured later via Wizard.
Mistral API key can be provided at first run to unlock local/online AI stabilization.

This story also runs the hot reload/self-heal verification described in `v1.3.1-milestones.md` so `REPAIR`, `REBOOT`, and `PLUGIN` keep logging healthy stats to `memory/logs/health-training.log` as part of the v1.1+ roadmap.

## Repository Root Setup

```story

help: >
  Path to uDOS repository root (contains uDOS.py marker file).

  For container deployments: /home/user/uDOS (standard Docker path)
  For local development: ~/Code/uDOS or your actual repo location

  This enables proper path resolution across Core, Wizard, Goblin, and App components.
  Auto-detected from local setup, but required for container or unusual installations.
validation: path
```

## Training & Dev Ops

- This story writes the latest hot reload/self-heal summary to `memory/logs/health-training.log` so automation can verify the training pass before moving on.
- Completing the flow confirms the local repo/memory/system/vault structure plus the CLI dev operations (REPAIR/REBOOT/PLUGIN) remain ready per the v1.1+ roadmap.
- After submission, the completion banner reprints the directories (local repo, memory, system, vault, framework seed) with status indicators and references `docs/SEED-INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md`, ensuring the “local memory/system + vault structure” is explicitly confirmed before resuming the next milestone.

## Complete

✅ **Core identity saved to .env!**

Your local setup is complete. These values are stored in:
- `.env` file (local Core boundary)
- `memory/system` (seed templates, zipped by REPAIR --seed)
- `local/memory` storage (verified via `docs/SEED-INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md`)

**Next:**
- **SETUP --profile** → View your settings
- **STORY wizard-setup** → Continue with Wizard identity & keystore
- **HELP** → See all commands
