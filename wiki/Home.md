# uDOS Wiki Home

Welcome. This wiki is the fast path for orientation.

Use it to understand what uDOS is, where to start, and where to go next.
For implementation detail, contracts, and runbooks, use `docs/`.

## Start Here

- [Installation](Installation.md)
- [Core](Core.md)
- [Wizard](Wizard.md)
- [Modes and Policy](Modes-and-Policy.md)
- [Self-Healing](Self-Healing.md)

## Quick Navigation

- New operator: [Installation](Installation.md) -> [Core](Core.md) -> [Wizard](Wizard.md)
- Working with runtime behavior: [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) -> [TypeScript Runtime](TypeScript-Runtime.md)
- Gameplay/runtime lane context: [TUI Z-Layer and TOYBOX](TUI-Z-Layer-and-TOYBOX.md)
- Development tools: [Dev Tools](Dev-Tools.md)

## Go Deeper in Docs

- Canonical docs index: [../docs/README.md](../docs/README.md)
- Active roadmap: [../docs/roadmap.md](../docs/roadmap.md)
- Specs catalog: [../docs/specs/README.md](../docs/specs/README.md)
- How-to guides: [../docs/howto/](../docs/howto/)
- Architecture decisions: [../docs/decisions/](../docs/decisions/)
- Troubleshooting: [../docs/troubleshooting/README.md](../docs/troubleshooting/README.md)

## Keep in Mind

- Wiki pages stay intentionally short.
- `docs/` is the source of truth for detailed behavior and contracts.
