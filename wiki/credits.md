## Inspiration

### Retro Computing

uDOS draws inspiration from classic computing interfaces:

- **MS-DOS** — Command-line simplicity and power
- **Commodore 64** — BASIC programming accessibility
- **BeOS** — Clean, efficient system design
- **Classic Mac OS** — User-friendly computing
- **Unix Philosophy** — Do one thing well

### Modern Influences

Contemporary projects that shaped uDOS:

- **Markdown** — Simple, readable documentation format
- **TypeScript** — Type-safe programming
- **Python** — Clear, expressive code
- **Node.js** — JavaScript everywhere
- **Svelte** — Reactive UI framework

## Retro Computing Tribute

uDOS pays homage to the golden age of personal computing. Elements inspired by vintage systems include:

- ASCII art and text-based interfaces
- Executable document paradigm (echoing batch files and shell scripts)
- Command-line interaction patterns
- Retro color schemes and aesthetics

**Note:** These elements are tributes and artistic expressions. uDOS is an original work and does not infringe on any copyrights or trademarks. All retro computing references are respectful acknowledgments of computing history.

## Philosophy

> "The best interface is no interface—just you, your ideas, and a command line."

uDOS believes in:
- Text over graphics (when appropriate)
- Keyboard over mouse (for power users)
- Code as documentation
- Simplicity as sophistication
