# Empire Documentation (Private)

Empire is uDOS's paid business extension. It is private, unreleased, and in active development.

## Product Positioning
- **Commercial add-on** for business and contact-management workflows.
- **Only business-focused extension** in the uDOS ecosystem.
- All other Core/Wizard capabilities remain user/personal oriented.

## Architecture Principles
- **Separated from Core/Wizard public paths** (no public docs or UI references).
- **Soft-fail behavior** when Empire is missing or the host system is not capable.
- **Extension-style deployment** compatible with container/plugin packaging.

## Release Planning
- Target a paid, commercial release.
- Maintain private development until release readiness.
