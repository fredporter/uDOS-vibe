# Theme Packs

uDOS publishes Markdown via a universal Theme Pack contract (`docs/Theme-Pack-Contract.md`). Each pack lives under `themes/<name>/` and includes:

- `shell.html`: static HTML wrapper with named slots (`{{content}}`, `{{title}}`, `{{meta}}`, `{{nav}}`, `{{footer}}`)
- `theme.css` plus any prebuilt assets (fonts, icons, sprites)
- `theme.json`: metadata (name, version, mode, slots, dependencies, typography, scripts)

# Theme CSS

- `theme.css` → entry point, includes tokens and imports the compiled `tw-prose.css`.
- `tw-prose.css` → generated by `npm run build:themes` (uses Tailwind Typography).
- `assets/token.css` defines shared CSS tokens.

Deliverables emit HTML to `memory/vault/_site/<theme>/...` so Wizard can serve them directly. Keep each pack framework-free so static publishing remains independent of SvelteKit control surfaces.

## Stub Theme Generator

Need placeholder themes for UI wiring or tests? Run:

```bash
python3 themes/scripts/generate_stub_themes.py
```

This clones the `prose` theme into `nes`, `c64`, `medium`, and `teletext` stubs with updated `theme.json` metadata.
