# Sonic Stick – Overview

**Project:** uDOS Beta Dev  
**Codename:** Sonic Stick  

The Sonic Stick is a 128 GB bootable USB system used to provision, repair, and manage a multi-OS machine with strict role separation:

- uDOS (Alpine Linux) as the primary OS
- Ubuntu as a Wizard Server (orchestration layer)
- Windows 10 as a sealed gaming console OS (Fortnite-compatible)

The stick functions as a portable control plane and assumes no trust in the local machine until provisioning is complete.
